API Details:

Our current API contains four protocols for requesting and receiving information from and to the backend.

/buttons returns an array of each of the details for the styling and content of the till_buttons
/items returns an array of each of the items which are a part of the current transaction table
/click has a button id as a parameter and will increase the quantity of an item in the transaction table and refresh the page.
/itemclick has a button id as a parameter and will delete an item (with all of its quantity) from the transaction table and refresh the page.

These endpoints are individually defined in the server and are accessed through the controller within a function called
"registerApi" which handles the creation of the appropriate url to be sent out.
